1. Fixed the Wii/Wii Mote controller abnormal button problem when vibration happens.
2. Added L3 and R3 for JoyCons.
3. Fixed the abnormal vibration problem of the game "Fire Emblem: ThreeHouses" on switch console.
4. Changed vibration levels adjust hot key from  L1+R1+SELECT(PS4:SHARE) to L2+R2+SELECT(PS4:SHARE), it would avoid conflicts with the game reset hot key.
